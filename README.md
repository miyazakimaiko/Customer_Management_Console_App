## Customer Management Console Overview

Create a simple Customer management application.

Version 1:
---------

The app will display a single menu with the following options:
1. View existing Customers
2. Add Customer
3. Exit

(If the user doesn't enter 1, 2, or 3, simply redisplay the menu)

A Customer has the following pieces of information:
  - Forename
  - Surname
  - Phone Number
  - Email Address
  - Postcode

The View existing Customers option will display a table listing all Customers currently held in the system.

Add Customer will allow the user to enter the five pieces of information describing a new customer. This new customer should be visisible the next time the user selects the option to View existing Customers.

(Customer data will be hard-coded)

Version 2:
---------

Add one more field to the Customer record - CustomerID. This will be unique and automatically generated.
